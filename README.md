## Problem description
Students implement a tic-tac-toe game (Vietnamese: trò chơi caro). For simplicity, students just
need to implement 3x3 maps. Student will control player 1, Computer will control player 2 (and
vice versa).

Students choose any adversarial search. Using that adversarial search to find the optimal
path, which will help the Computer to win this game.

Students must implement the interface of tic-tac-toe game. Note:
- You can use `pygame` or `tkinter` (python library), those libraries are so easy to learn and
use.
- The main purpose of this project is learning Adversarial search, please do not focus on
application or interface (just easy to look are enough).
